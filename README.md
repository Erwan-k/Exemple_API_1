Hello,

Here you will find an API made with python flask.

After you cloned the repository, you can run "python main.py".

You can try the routes connexion1 and connexion2 with localhost:5000/connexion1 and localhost:5000/connexion2.

I suggest using postman or a simple python script using requests librairy.

Enjoy,

Erwan
